Refurbished Watches — Static Site (Vite + React + Tailwind)

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the printed local URL (http://localhost:5173 by default).

Notes

- The site is a lightweight React app using Vite and Tailwind.
- Watch images use placeholder images (Picsum/Unsplash). Replace with real photos in `src/pages` or a `public` folder.
- The Google Maps embed points to Bucharest.

Next steps you might want:
- Add real images in `/public` and update routes
- Configure analytics or forms for `Contact`
